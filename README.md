# Do something

This is a little project a threw together to help me get off my ass and do things. It is deployed to github pages at https://shadowronin.github.io/do-something/

## Future Features
- have UI for modifying things to do
- have it push for healthier things
    - but still let me do fun things sometimes
        - maybe somewhat based on time of day?
- turn it into a task tracker app so i can:
    - alternatively integrate with an existing tracking app
    - list different projects/things
    - it can specify sub-goals to work on
    - so i can track stuff
- have a timer
    - e.g. do this think for at least 30min

## Technology
